# Change: Update Compass UI

## Why
The current compass UI feels dated. The user requested specific improvements to the layout (cardinal directions), iconography (Qibla icon), and styling (arrow design) to match a modern minimalistic aesthetic.

## What Changes
- **Compass Layout**: Move N, S, E, W labels to the outer ring.
- **Iconography**: Remove the background from the Qibla icon for a cleaner look.
- **Styling**: Redesign the direction arrow to be more modern/sleek.
- **Theme**: Refine colors and fonts to ensure high contrast and elegance.

## Impact
- **Code**: `src/components/CompassView.tsx`
- **Specs**: UI requirements for the Compass component.
